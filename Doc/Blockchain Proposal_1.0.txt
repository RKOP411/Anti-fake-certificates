Proposal: Decentralized Certificate Verification Using NFTs Cert and AI ai_validation

1. Background
In order to prevent fake academic certificates and directly verify them 
without a third party, we propose a decentralized system that utilizes 
NFTs for certificate issuance and AI for validation. This system will 
allow universities to issue certificates as NFTs, which can be verified 
by employers directly on the blockchain.

Also, current existing solutions (e.g., Blockcerts) lack real-time AI 
fraud detection and real identity verification. Therefore, we aim to 
integrate advanced AI algorithms to enhance the verification process 
and ensure the authenticity of the certificates.
